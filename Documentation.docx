a. Introduction
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless transport and best effort delivery with minimal overhead. They result into speedy communication due to 
    the protocol not performing an acknowledgement before transferring the data to the destination. However, with the speed it delivers, UDP also has its own 
    trade-offs with one of these being losing the packets as they go from source to destination; this leaves the protocol to be unreliable for data transferring
    along with unordered delivery, statlessness and lack of congestion control. This is why when it comes to transferring data Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    is deemed to be more reliable and complete. With this in mind, we created an implementation of TCP in UDP using Python done through socket programming with TCP
    features such as acknowledgement, sessions, error handling, retransmission strategies and file transfer protocols.
